<H2>Warren, dems take aim at HOP Senate majority</H2>
<body>MANCHESTER, New Hampshire — Monday was Sen. Elizabeth Warren's turn to join her fellow Democrats in cranking up the heat on her Republican colleagues in the Senate, who have become as big of targets as Donald Trump in the closing days of the campaign. <br>
<P>

<strong>Addressing an enthusiastic outdoor rally on a crisp New England autumn day, Warren had plenty of barbs for Trump, whom she has demonstrated a unique ability to provoke. But the Massachusetts Democrat also tore into this state's Republican incumbent, Sen. Kelly Ayotte, with unusual ferocity.</strong><br>
<p>
"Donald Trump is right. Kelly is weak," Warren said, ticking through a list of Trump's offenses Ayotte had allegedly abided before finally "running as fast as she can away from him" once his poll numbers tanked.<br>
<p>
"Donald Trump sure has made Kelly Ayotte dance. Day one she loves him, day two she hates him, day three she's back with him — boy, spins round and round," Warren told hundreds on a lawn at St. Anselm College.
